# ***Day 1: Introduction to Bioinformatics***

<ins>Objective:</ins>

-Gain foundational knowledge of bioinformatics and its role in modern science.

-Select a research focus for the internship project.

<ins> Process:</ins>

1.Understanding Bioinformatics:
   
   Bioinformatics combines biology, computer science, and statistics to analyze biological data.
   Learned about its applications in genomics, proteomics, drug discovery, and personalized medicine.

2.Choosing a Research Focus:
   
   Selected <ins>Wilson's Disease</ins> as the disease to research, given its genetic basis and reliance on bioinformatics for drug discovery.
   Discussed its pathological mechanism—excessive copper accumulation—and its systemic effects on the liver, brain, and other organs.

3.Setting Goals:
   
   Decided to explore penicillamine, a primary treatment for Wilson's Disease, and its alternatives.
   Planned to use computational tools for drug discovery tasks.
