# **Day 4: Understanding 3D Conformers**
## <ins>Objective:</ins>
  Generate and analyze 3D molecular conformers to study spatial arrangements of penicillamine and related molecules.
## <ins>Process:</ins>
- What Are 3D Conformers?

    - Conformers are 3D spatial representations of a molecule showing different arrangements of its atoms.
    - They are critical for understanding how drugs interact with biological targets, such as enzymes or metal ions.

- Generating 3D Conformers in KNIME:

    - Used a KNIME workflow to import the 2D structure of penicillamine and generate multiple 3D conformers.
    - Optimized the conformers using force-field calculations, ensuring realistic spatial configurations.

- Analyzing 3D Structures:

  Visualized the generated conformers to study their geometry, focusing on:

    - Bond angles and lengths.
    - Spatial arrangement of the sulfhydryl (-SH) group, which is critical for copper binding.

  Compared the 3D conformers of penicillamine with other copper chelators to understand differences in binding potential.

- Conformer Clustering:

   Clustered conformers based on similarity using RMSD (Root Mean Square Deviation) to identify the most stable and biologically relevant structures.
## <ins>Insights:</ins>
  
  - Found that the spatial arrangement of penicillamine's functional groups plays a key role in its efficacy as a chelator.
  - Observed how alternative molecules might offer improved binding or reduced side effects based on their conformer stability.
