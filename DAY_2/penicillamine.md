# Day 2: Mechanism of Action of Penicillamine

## <ins>Objective:</ins>

Research and document the mechanism of action of penicillamine, the most commonly used drug for Wilson's Disease.

## <ins>Process:</ins>

- Understanding Penicillamine's Role:

    Penicillamine is a copper chelator used to reduce copper toxicity.

    Studied its chemical structure and its ability to bind with copper ions through its sulfhydryl (-SH) group.

    Explored its clinical effects, including how it helps remove copper via urinary excretion.

- Analyzing Side Effects and Challenges:
   
   Learned about common side effects like hypersensitivity, neurological worsening, and renal complications.
   
   Explored how these limitations necessitate the search for alternative therapies.


## <ins>How Penicillamine Works</ins>

1. üß™ Copper Chelation:

Penicillamine contains a sulfhydryl group (-SH) that binds tightly to free copper ions in the body, forming a stable copper-penicillamine complex.

2. üö∞ Copper Elimination:

Once bound, this complex is flushed out of the body through urine, reducing harmful copper levels in the liver and brain.

3. ‚öñÔ∏è Prevents Accumulation:
Regular treatment restores balance, preventing copper buildup and protecting against organ damage.

4. üí° Symptom Reversal:

By reducing copper levels, penicillamine can help reverse severe symptoms like liver dysfunction, neurological impairments, and even the iconic Kayser-Fleischer rings in the eyes.

## Challenges with Penicillamine

While it‚Äôs a powerful treatment, penicillamine has its share of challenges. Side effects like hypersensitivity reactions, worsening neurological symptoms, and the need for lifelong compliance make it tricky to manage in some patients.
