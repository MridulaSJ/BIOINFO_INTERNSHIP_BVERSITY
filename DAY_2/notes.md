# Day 2: Mechanism of Action of Penicillamine

## <ins>Objective:</ins>

Research and document the mechanism of action of penicillamine, the most commonly used drug for Wilson's Disease.

## <ins>Process:</ins>

- Understanding Penicillamine's Role:

    Penicillamine is a copper chelator used to reduce copper toxicity.

    Studied its chemical structure and its ability to bind with copper ions through its sulfhydryl (-SH) group.

    Explored its clinical effects, including how it helps remove copper via urinary excretion.

- Analyzing Side Effects and Challenges:
   
   Learned about common side effects like hypersensitivity, neurological worsening, and renal complications.
   
   Explored how these limitations necessitate the search for alternative therapies.
