ðŸŒŸ #**Bversity Bioinformatics Internship Project**

Welcome to the repository showcasing my work during the <ins>Bversity's Bioinformatics Internship</ins> . Over the course of this internship, I explored bioinformatics concepts and applied them to real-world challenges, focusing on drug discovery for **Wilson's Disease**.

This repository contains all project files, workflows, and results generated during the internship. Feel free to explore and share feedback!

ðŸ“‹ ##_**Project Overview**_

This project investigates Wilson's Disease, a rare genetic disorder caused by copper accumulation in vital organs, and focuses on _penicillamine_, a drug commonly used for its treatment.
The internship provided hands-on experience with tools like KNIME, data visualization techniques, and molecular analysis processes.
