ðŸŒŸ Bversity Bioinformatics Internship Project

Welcome to the repository showcasing my work during the Bversity Bioinformatics Internship. Over the course of this internship, I explored bioinformatics concepts and applied them to real-world challenges, focusing on drug discovery for Wilson's Disease.

This repository contains all project files, workflows, and results generated during the internship. Feel free to explore and share feedback!

ðŸ“‹ Project Overview

This project investigates Wilson's Disease, a rare genetic disorder caused by copper accumulation in vital organs, and focuses on penicillamine, a drug commonly used for its treatment.
The internship provided hands-on experience with tools like KNIME, data visualization techniques, and molecular analysis processes.
