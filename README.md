# **Bversity Bioinformatics Internship**

Welcome to the repository showcasing my work during the <ins>Bversity's Bioinformatics Internship</ins> . Over the course of this internship, I explored bioinformatics concepts and applied them to real-world challenges, focusing on drug discovery for **Wilson's Disease**.

This repository contains all project files, workflows, and results generated during the internship. Feel free to explore and share feedback!

## _**Project Overview**_

This project investigates Wilson's Disease, a rare genetic disorder caused by copper accumulation in vital organs, and focuses on _penicillamine_, a drug commonly used for its treatment.
The internship provided hands-on experience with tools like KNIME, data visualization techniques, and molecular analysis processes.

### **Day 1: Introduction to Bioinformatics**  
- **Objective:** Gain an understanding of bioinformatics and its applications.  
- **Key Learnings:**  
  - Selected **Wilson's Disease** as the target disease for research.  
  - Studied the basics of drug discovery and how bioinformatics tools play a role in molecular analysis.

### **Day 2: Mechanism of Action of Penicillamine**
- **Objective:** Research and document how penicillamine treats Wilson's Disease.
- **Key Insights:**
  - Penicillamine binds to free copper ions in the body to form a stable complex.
  - This complex is excreted through urine, reducing copper toxicity in the liver and brain.
  - Long-term treatment restores copper balance and prevents further accumulation.

### **Day 3: Heatmap Analysis Using KNIME**  
- **Objective:** Compare penicillamine with other drug molecules.
- **Key Insights:**
   - Generated a heatmap showing molecular similarities between penicillamine and a library of decoppering agents, antioxidants, and antirheumatic drugs.
   - Identified promising alternatives for Wilson's Disease treatment.

### **Day 4: Understanding 3D Conformers**
- **Objective:** Explore 3D molecular conformers in KNIME and their role in understanding molecular behavior.
- **Key Insights:**
     - 3D conformers provide a realistic view of molecular shapes and interactions.
     - This is critical for evaluating drug binding and efficacy.

### **Day 5: Coefficient Calculation & GitHub Learning**
- **Objective:** Calculate coefficients for 2D and 3D conformers and learn GitHub for project management.
- **Key Insights:**
      - Coefficients provide quantitative metrics for molecular analysis.
      - Explored GitHub to manage and share bioinformatics projects.
