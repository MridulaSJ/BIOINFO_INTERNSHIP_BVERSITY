# **Bversity Bioinformatics Internship**

Welcome to the repository showcasing my work during the <ins>Bversity's Bioinformatics Internship</ins> . Over the course of this internship, I explored bioinformatics concepts and applied them to real-world challenges, focusing on drug discovery for **Wilson's Disease**.

This repository contains all project files, workflows, and results generated during the internship. Feel free to explore and share feedback!

## _**Project Overview**_

This project investigates Wilson's Disease, a rare genetic disorder caused by copper accumulation in vital organs, and focuses on _penicillamine_, a drug commonly used for its treatment.
The internship provided hands-on experience with tools like KNIME, data visualization techniques, and molecular analysis processes.

### **Day 1: Introduction to Bioinformatics**  
- **Objective:** Gain an understanding of bioinformatics and its applications.  
- **Key Learnings:**  
  - Selected **Wilson's Disease** as the target disease for research.  
  - Studied the basics of drug discovery and how bioinformatics tools play a role in molecular analysis.
